A python script to get the session count and duration of a user from the given log file.

Python Version used : **Python 3.10.12**

**Step 1** : Download the log_parser.py file.
**Step 2** : Install python version 3.10.12
**Step 3** : You can run the file by the command : **python3 log_parser.py samplelog.txt**

where log_parser.py file is the file where the code to execute is written and samplelog.txt is the log file.
Both the files are in the same location so the path of the log file is just the file name otherwise the second command line argument should be the path of the log file.
